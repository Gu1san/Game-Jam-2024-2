# Refúgio

## 🕹️ Overview  
**Refúgio** was created during a 48-hour Game Jam, based on the theme of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The game is a decision-based experience where players manage resources in a refugee camp, making strategic choices to ensure the well-being of its inhabitants.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Decision-Making Mechanics**:  
  - Players face strategic decisions to balance limited resources.  
  - Choices impact the survival and morale of the camp's inhabitants.  

- **Dynamic Resource Management**:  
  - Manage food, water, and money.  
  - React to events that affect the camp’s stability and well-being.    

## 🔧 Technologies and Solutions  
The core feature of the game is its dynamic event system, designed using **Scriptable Objects**. This approach makes the system highly scalable and easy to expand with new content.  

Each event can be customized to control:  
- The **impact of player choices** on various metrics (e.g., resources, morale).  
- The **NPC model** associated with the event.  
- The **NPC's pose**, ensuring it aligns contextually with their dialogue and the situation.  

This modular design allows for rapid iteration and the seamless addition of new events or mechanics.
